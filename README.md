## About
The College Scorecard project is intended to provide students and parents a full understanding of the cost and benefits of higher education. This project expands on that intention by providing users the ability to discover and compare schools based on a a school's student profile, costs, and outcomes.

Use the filters below to discover schools that match your prefences. Then you can save and compare schools.


## Current state
March 3, 3017: This is a capstone project build for the completion of the Web Development Certificate at Seattle University. 
The current page is a proof of concept intended to provide greater access to the College Scorecard data

### Notes on College Scorecard
College Scorecard data is still maintained by the U.S. Department of Education. It is unclear if this data source will be maintained indefenitately

### Future improvements

* Improve search funcationality to include non-numeric filters
* Pass API parameters based on input so to only add API parameters on user input to increase search speed
* Turn on remove from local storage function from within grid
* Integrate data from additional sources including, but not limited, 3rd party school rankings (U.S. News, Wall Street Journal, Princeton Review), other government sources (The Integrated Post-Secondary Educations Data System [IPEDS]), or other defined sources
